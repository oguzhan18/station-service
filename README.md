# Station Service Project
## Overview
The Station Service project is a NestJS application designed to manage and stream music files for virtual radio stations. Each station can upload and queue music files, stream them to clients, and handle multiple clients simultaneously. This service is particularly useful for creating online radio stations where users can upload music and stream it live.
## Features
* Create Stations: Dynamically create new radio stations with unique IDs.
* Upload Music: Upload music files to specific stations.
* Stream Music: Stream music files in a loop to connected clients.
* Station Status: Get the current playback status of a station, including the current file, file size, and playback position.
## Technologies Used
* NestJS: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
* TypeScript: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
* Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
Jest: A delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity.
